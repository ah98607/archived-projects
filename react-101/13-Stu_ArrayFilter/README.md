# Filter

In this activity we will utilize the Array filter method in order to loop over an existing array and return a brand new filtered array.

## Instructions

* Open [filterActivities.js](Unsolved/filterActivity.js) and complete the tasks outlined in the comments.

* Prefer arrow function callbacks in this activity, as they'll be more useful when working with React.

### Hints

* See [MDN Documentation for Array.prototype.filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter)
